# Highway-Traffic-Simulator
This java project simulates traffic flow. It takes advantage of multithreading, several threads operate concurrently to represent 

(1) the cars

(2) the  traffic flow volume 

It can link information of real-time traffic flow from different locations to broadcast short-term traffic status.
